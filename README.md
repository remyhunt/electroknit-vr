## What is this? 
Electroknit Dymaxion is a textile-based sculpture that takes the form of an Icosahedron. The interior is a map of knitted patterns that correspond to the geographic regions represented in Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion map, a projection that represented earths' continents as one unified landmass.

Here is [a d3.js version of Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map](https://observablehq.com/@remyhunt/dymaxion-fuller-airocean-projection-d3-sketching)
